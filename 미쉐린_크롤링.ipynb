Not only did this fine purveyor of natural wine and cuisine change its name, but it also revamped its exterior and décor with a touch of contemporary elegance. Regardless, its pasta dishes, the quintessential offerings, have remained the same – only with enhanced flavors. The diner’s housemade pasta now features higher flour content and undergoes fermentation. The glutinous texture and impeccable pairing with the sauce make the pasta even more appetizing. In addition to a diverse array of pasta dishes, the menu features salads, meat, and various other scrumptious dishes. Come on down and savor your meal with a chef-recommended natural wine replete with a cultured vibe.\n",

Among all the exquisite items on the menu, we are partial to the bisque pasta, featuring al dente noodles and a sumptuous amount of fresh and savory red-banded lobster, as well as the newly added Mare (“sea”) course. When paired with a chef-recommended wine, the cuisine will astonish you with the rich flavors of Italy.\n",

This progressive aspect of Palate is well reflected in the cuisine it serves today. When it comes to dining, Busan has much respect for the old and traditional. This urban dining landscape makes one wonder how the chef’s ever-evolving culinary experiments will translate into gastronomic revolutions. A cityscape out the windows that includes Yonghoman Bay Wharf and Gwangandaegyo Bridge creates an alluring vibe that serves as a fine companion to Palate’s fare.\n",

Though not as authentic as the ones in old Japanese houses, the irori here is faithful to its role as kitchen equipment. The visual and aromatic appeal of grilling seasonal fish skewers, arranged in a row in front of the irori, adds to the diner’s culinary delight. An embodiment of Chef Jung Eu-tteum’s experience with Japanese cuisine and his personal gastronomic affinities, the eatery is a perfect haven to relish a diverse array of grilled fish. Clay pot rice and other dishes served during the omakase course boast a range of refined flavors that often characterize Japanese cuisine.\n",

      "Located on a boulevard near Jungdong Intersection in the Haeundae District, Torafuguga stands out with its quaint wooden exterior and a small aquarium with live torafuku (tiger puffer) at the front. The eatery has no sign except for a small calligraphy of its name penned by the owner-chef Jung Seung-hun himself. Yet, these visual elements are enough to let you know that it’s a specialist puffer fish restaurant. Here, the chef’s precise hand movements bring out the variegated flavors of tiger puffer and deliver them, nonstop, to customers at the tables. Torafuguga’s Japanese-style puffer fish course features a wide array of faithful dishes that are parboiled, served raw in slices, fried, made into a soup, or crafted into a porridge. There are many restaurants that handle puffer fish, but few show commitment to presenting it in authentic Japanese style. In light of this, the chef’s earnestness in preparing and serving puffer fish testifies to his passion for culinary art.\n",

It’ll make you nod in appreciation. The dish also has a distinct flavor that evokes those of many other Korean soups. Indeed, the diner has successfully differentiated itself from countless other famed restaurants in Busan, the capital of dwaeji-gukbap, giving the impression that it continues to change and evolve while exploring diverse culinary directions.

Brown-backed puffer is chewy and has a nutty flavor. Globe puffer is large and often made into a spicy stew. Yellowfin puffer is sweet, so it is usually steamed or boiled. Ocellate puffer is the largest variety of the fish. Its firm texture makes the fish more suitable to be served raw. Safety is the first priority at this head restaurant as demonstrated by the hiring of dozens of chefs, all licensed to prepare puffer fish.

      "Kumsu Bokguk in Haeundae District is the head restaurant of a chain that has many outposts in Seoul and Busan. For more than 50 years since 1970, and across multiple generations, this eatery has delighted seafood lovers as a specialized puffer fish restaurant. It offers four types of puffer fish. Brown-backed puffer is chewy and has a nutty flavor. Globe puffer is large and often made into a spicy stew. Yellowfin puffer is sweet, so it is usually steamed or boiled. Ocellate puffer is the largest variety of the fish. Its firm texture makes the fish more suitable to be served raw. Safety is the first priority at this head restaurant as demonstrated by the hiring of dozens of chefs, all licensed to prepare puffer fish. So why not rest assured and visit this time-tested establishment for a gastronomic adventure?\n",

The owner says he opened this joint merely out of his love for Hong Kong. It serves less-than-authentic Hong Kong dishes, slightly modified to suit the Korean palate. Still, their flavors and visuals are no less spectacular than those of the local Hong Kong cuisine. Signatures include pleasantly spicy tomato noodle soup with plenty of tomato and ham; bread generously glazed with condensed milk and syrup; sweet nai cha (milk tea); and dong ning cha (iced lemon tea). The diner’s Hong Kong-style visuals are a plus!\n",

      "Located on Dalmaji Hill, Fiotto is a cozy little bistro run by a couple that serves meals based around pasta dishes. At first, the eatery’s decision to offer a pasta-only course may seem a little odd. But once you experience it, you’ll find the myriad flavors of the varied pasta dishes incredibly enjoyable. To create Fiotto’s distinct natural flavors, the chef couple almost always rely on ingredients that are house made or directly sourced, including several fresh pastas and fresh hams; veggies from their family farm co-owned with their parents; and vinegar and syrup made from kombucha. Thanks to these sustainable elements, Fiotto’s pasta-only course is easy on the stomach. Only one group of diners is served per hour to ensure smooth operation, so reservations are a must.\n",
